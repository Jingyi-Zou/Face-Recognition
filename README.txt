MTCNN

Console arguments:
runfile('Your own directory/MTCNN/align_dataset_mtcnn.py', args='Your own directory/MTCNN/images Your own directory/MTCNN/images_aligned', wdir='Your own directory')

1. If you want to get your images detected and aligned only, go to align_dataset_mtcnn.py and run the arguments above.
2. If you want to test your images and show the bounding boxes and facial landmarks, run bbox_landmark.py.
Here I recommend the 2nd one.

I already detected and aligned some images in folder "images", and stored the results in folder "images_aligned" to show the effectiveness of this method.
